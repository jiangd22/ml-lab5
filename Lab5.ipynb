To evaluate our model, the only metric that matters is the recall score. We want to minimize the number of false negatives (students who are at risk of dropping out but are not identified to be at risk) as much as possible. We can tolerate a higher number of false positives (students who are not at risk of dropping out but are identified to be at risk) as long as we are able to identify all students who are at risk of dropping out. This is because we can provide early intervention to students who are falsely identified as at risk, but we cannot help students who are not identified as at risk. Therefore, the recall score will be the most important metric for evaluating our model. We will aim for a recall score of at least 0.75 to ensure that we are able to identify at least 75% of students who are at risk of dropping out. This also means that for status of \"Graduate\" and \"Enrolled\", we will aim for a recall score of 0.75 or higher just to make the metrics easier to evaluate. In the event of a recall score is below 0.75, we can isolate just the dropout status and do a dropout recall score only acceptance criteria for the model.",

    "Please take a look at the breakdown of student status from above. We can see that the dataset is imbalanced with the majority of students being \"Graduate\", followed by \"Dropout\", and then \"Enrolled\". The best strategy for splitting the dataset would be Stratified 10-Fold Cross-Validation. This will ensure that each fold has the same distribution of student statuses as the original dataset, assuming that the dataset is large enough which this one is. This way, we can preserve the class distribution and eliminate the chance of either over- or under-represented status. Although Shuffle Split with Stratification could also work, we will use Stratified 10-Fold Cross-Validation as it is more robust and reliable.\n",

    "Plus in a market setting, the most optimal training dataset should be provided by the client. School records are much cheaper to obtained given most academic institution naturally keeps records. Thus, the affordability of obtaining a large dataset is not a problem. So we can assume that the dataset is large enough to use Stratified 10-Fold Cross-Validation."
